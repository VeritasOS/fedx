# Welcome to the FedX Repository

FedX is a practical framework for transparent access to Linked Data sources through a federation. 
It incorporates new sophisticated optimization techniques combined with effective variants of existing
techniques and is thus a highly scalable solution for practical federated query processing.


# FedX has moved

Veritas [contributed](https://rdf4j.org/news/2019/10/15/fedx-joins-rdf4j/) FedX to the Eclipse [RDF4J project](https://rdf4j.org/). Development continues there, please see https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j.
